 AWS Cloud Formation Stacks for various uses

## Axonius CFT

**NOTE:** the cft template uses the full assumed role from the Axonius AWS account which is:

``arn:aws:sts::604119231150:assumed-role/st-progress-55b41cac3f4e8e4a-MasterIamRole-1E7WQM8C64QQ/i-031885b89ea460f85``

as an option (if this is not working), you can try assuming root

``arn:aws:iam::604119231150:root``
